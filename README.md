# Online Survey using R
Online Survey using R that gives access to collaborators to view survey results in real-time along with authentication. 
An original survey management web-based tools in which members of the research team can directly go to the website that I have developed, enter their user and password; they can see the summary of results and make informed decisions about data characteristics, distribution, and response rate. A sample demo (not real data) can be accessed [HERE](https://aalbusaidi.shinyapps.io/surveyAr/) on the left, click on Results> user = *admin1*, password = *admin1*, and try it yourself. Feel free to adopt the code for your own projects.
